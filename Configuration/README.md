# Personal Access Token

## Benefits 

Personal access tokens are an alternative to using passwords for authentication to GitHub when using the GitHub API or the command line.

==================================================================
If you're accessing GitHub APIs programmatically, using a PAT is the recommended method. It ensures secure communication between your applications and GitHub services.
==================================================================
GitHub provides logs and audit trails for actions performed using Personal Access Tokens. This helps in tracking and understanding who performed what actions in your repositories.
